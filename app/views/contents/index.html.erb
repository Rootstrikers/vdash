          <h3>Where did these posts come from?</h3>
          <p>Rootstrikers volunteers submitted links to news articles. Others volunteers thought they were great and wrote Tweets and Facebook posts to publicize them. These are the results of that volunteer effort.</p>
          <h3>How to get started:</h3>
          <p>Vote for the very best posts. Once a post gets enough votes from Rootstrikers volunteers, the staff will post it to Rootstriker's Facebook page or Twitter feed (or both).</p>
          <h3>How should I decide which one to vote for?</h3>
          <p>Vote for only the very best posts. Here are some criteria to help you decide which ones are the best. Great social media posts are:
		<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left:25px;padding-top:15px;">
			<li>Concise (as short as possible to get the idea across),</li>
			<li>Accurate (don't exaggerate or embelish the news they are sharing unnecessariliy),</li>
			<li>Exciting (share only the most important news using humor, irony, sarcasm, or astounding but accurate facts),</li>
			<li>Grammatically correct (free of spelling and grammatical errors),</li>
			<li>Viral (link to/tag appropriate others. For example, if a story is about Barack Obama, it could include a tag "@BarackObama")</li>
		</ul>
          </p>
