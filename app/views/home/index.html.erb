          <h3>What is it?</h3>

          <p>Rootstrikers is a new generation of activists taking on the corrupting influence of money in politics.</p>

          <p>The Rootstrikers Volunteer Dashboard is where you can help find and choose important news stories that Rootstrikers will post to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rootstrikers">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rootstrikers">Twitter</a> pages.</p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>

            <p>News stories go through a super simple 5 step process to make sure the best stuff goes to our feeds.</p>

            <p><strong>Don't worry, you don't have to do them all!</strong>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Submit a link to a news story or other interesting page.</li>
                <li>Vote on the links you would most want to share with you friends.</li>
                <li>Write messages to go along with popular news stories.</li>
                <li>Vote on the various messages that go with each link.</li>
                <li>Rootstriker moderators sanity check the results and post them to Facebook or Twitter.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              The process is designed so you can start at the beginning or jump in somewhere along the way, and do as much or as little as you want. Give it a shot!
            </p>
